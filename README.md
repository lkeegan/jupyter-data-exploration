# Data Exploration with Python and Jupyter

## Course description

Jupyter notebooks are a great tool for exploring and interacting with data using the Python programming language and its rich ecosystem of libraries.
In this course we will cover basic usage of the Pandas library to download a dataset, explore its contents, clean up missing or invalid data, filter the data according to different criteria, and plot visualizations of the data.

## Preparation

You will need a computer with Python, Jupyter and pandas installed.

If you don't already have this, I recommend installing Anaconda (which contains all of this and more):

### Windows installation

1. download & run the [installer](https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2021.05-Windows-x86_64.exe) (default choices should be fine, registration is optional and can be ignored)

2. click on Start Menu -> Anaconda3 -> Jupyter Notebook

3. web browser should open, in top right click on New -> Notebook Python 3

4. notebook should open: type "import pandas" and press shift+enter

### MacOS/Linux installation
